    <p class="About">About Me</p>
    <p> I am a hiker, dancer, artist, nerd, mother, wife, sister, and maybe a little weird. I am a curiouse creature,
        therefore, explore all aspects of life. I explore the world by traveling and hiking, explore the various ways in
        which my body can move through dance, and I explore ideas through books, creativity, a desire to constantly
        learn. </p>
